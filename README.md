# Justin Joco's Portfolio Website 2.x
This website has been rebuilt from Bootstrap to React Bootstrap. This was done mostly to learn Reactjs and as a fun learning experience.
Here's what's included:
* A summary about me
* Projects made at hackathons or classes
* Work experiences
* Other cool stuff I did (like extracurriculars)
* Contact info
